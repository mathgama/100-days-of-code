# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: October 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Created a repo for a new project that will be a basic gallery of graffity photos taken around the world. Also created a basic design structure in plain html and css using bootstrap.

The goal was to set some basic design for the project so I don't have to think about it too much while getting into the React itself. There are some points that I'm still not happy with, like the login button and the submit button that should appear somewhere after the user is logged in. But I guess I should start this way and change those as new ideas come to mind.
